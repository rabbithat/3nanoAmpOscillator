# 3nanoampOscillator
LTSpice circuit simulation file for the 3 nanoamp oscillator described here: 
http://www.discovercircuits.com/DJ-Circuits/3na-osc.htm

This is in reference to a discussion here:  
https://forum.mysensors.org/topic/10812/the-harvester-ultimate-power-supply-for-the-raybeacon-dk/129

i am posting it here to make it easy for anyone who wants to run an LTSpice simulation of the circuit.
